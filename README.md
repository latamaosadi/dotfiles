# ðŸ›  Latamaosadi dotfiles

The purpose of this repository is to keep track of my personal dotfiles changes. So I don't need to get through all the trouble when I have to do a clean install on my dev machine. Everybody is free to use this configuration with their own caution.

## Install Homebrew formulae

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course):

```bash
./brew.sh
```

## Feedback
Suggestion, [issues](https://github.com/latamaosadi/dotfiles/issues) and improvement are more than welcome.
